### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I like working on technology, especially related to simulation, AI and games.

ðŸ”­ A project I worked on prior to starting full time employment was a flight simulator plugin for a forward-looking infra-red (FLIR) electro-optical camera. The aim of the plugin was to simulate the tasks of an observer for aerial surveillance.
The project includes:
- developing an X-Plane 11 plugin using the xppython3 API.
- developing a UI to display data related to the aircraft, camera and object tracking.
- object tracking with an off-the-shelf Yolov8 neural net model, processed separately on the GPU via a client/server python script.

Here's a sample of recent progress on real-time object tracking:
